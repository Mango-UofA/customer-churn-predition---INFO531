## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to predict bank customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to customers who are likely to leave the bank. By identifying such customers early, banks can implement targeted retention strategies.

We used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, performed data cleaning and preprocessing, trained classification models, and evaluated their performance.
